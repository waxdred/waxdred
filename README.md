## About me
Hi there, my name is Jonathan and I'm currently a student at 42 Lyon. I'm in the process of a professional reconversion and I'm excited to be learning new skills in the field of programming. I've been a student at 42 Lyon for 1 year and have been working hard to improve my programming skills.

My interests include back-end development, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. I am passionate about creating bots and automating tasks using Docker. My goal is to become an expert in back-end development and work on projects that utilize the latest technologies. I'm also interested in contributing to open-source projects and collaborating with other developers.

In my free time, I like to stay updated on the latest developments in technology and explore new programming languages and frameworks. I am a big fan of Go and I love to develop with GoLand, and recently I've been diving into Rust, it's a great programming language and I'm excited to learn more about it.
I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.
